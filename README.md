# DeVoe-Chair
This project is based on IOT(Internet of Things). IOT allows object to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,creating opportunities for more accuracy and improving efficiency.
DeVoeâ€™s Chair is a smart wheelchair which comes with a fall detection system,GPS tracking,sensing your body temperature,heart rate,intelligent picking along with a home automation system which can be controlled by google assistant or touch screen.This chair is the future of care services around the globe, be it daycare for children or old age homes for elderly people.The chair provides comfort and security to anyone who is in a need to carry out the basic day to day life activities. Their family members can keep an eye on whether or not the elderly are properly treated, parents can keep a watch over the location and activities of their children in daycares, or special schools.

Here is a generalised view of our Wheel chair (We will try our best to make it this way if possible):
